    <textOnly>Dear License Holder,

Thank you for your inquiry. The error was due to the creation of multiple Commercial Activity Licenses (CALs); we have removed the redundant CALs to correct the issue and you may now log back in to proceed.

Please log in to the eCLIPSE system here.

Once logged in, the information required to associate your License with your Account is as follows:
Activity License #: XXXX
City of Philadelphia Tax Account #:  XXXX
Social Security Number (SSN) OR Employer Identification Number (EIN): XXXX

Please reply to this email if you experience any further issues related to this. We appreciate your patience and thank you for your investment in the City of Philadelphia.

Sincerely,
Customer Care Staff
Department of L &amp; I</textOnly>
