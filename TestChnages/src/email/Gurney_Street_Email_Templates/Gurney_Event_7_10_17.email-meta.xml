    <textOnly>Summer is here! There has been great efforts made to increase support and recreational services in and around the Fairhill and West Kensington neighborhoods. Including the Conrail clean-up which is scheduled to begin on Monday, July 10th, 2017, and (30) PLAY STREET programs. PLAY STREETS is a Parks and Recreation program where lunch, snacks, and organized activities are provided between the hours of 9am – 4pm (Monday – Friday’s). At McPherson Square we will have a robust program of organized activities, swim lessons, field trips, STEM, arts &amp; cultural activities, and more!
