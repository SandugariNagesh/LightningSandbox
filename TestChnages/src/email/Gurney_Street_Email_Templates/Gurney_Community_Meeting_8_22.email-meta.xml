    <textOnly>Good Morning,


We are now into week three of Conrail’s Clean-Up and the physical environment in the community is transformational. Visit our facebook page for recent photos #El Barrio es Nuestro.


We continue to work with various social service providers in an effort to meet the needs of individuals afflicted by the opioids, the RV is stationed on A and Tusculum Streets. The Homelessness outreach team is actively canvassing the area and transporting individuals as needed. Beginning on Monday, August 21, there will be rotating provider agencies onsite at RV providing behavioral health screening/referral services to individuals seeking treatment. Screenings includes: education on SUD prevention, treatment and care. Through the assessment process providers identify additional needs including: ID’s, insurance, housing, basic needs, and medical needs. The RV’s hours of operation are Monday-Friday, 9:00am-4:00pm.
