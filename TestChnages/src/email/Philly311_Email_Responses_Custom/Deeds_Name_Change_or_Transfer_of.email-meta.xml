    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

Thank you for contacting the City of Philadelphia&apos;s 311 Contact Center about transferring a deed. To transfer a deed or change the name on one requires that a new deed be prepared by a title company or real estate lawyer; and then recorded with the Records Department located at City Hall, room 111. All current owners of the property must sign the deed transferring ownership to the new owners. Please contact the Recorder of Deeds at 215-686-2260 should you need further assistance related to the transferring of deeds.

For your convenience you may access our website at http://www.phila.gov/311/findananswer/Pages/default.aspx 24 hours a day, where you can find answers to many questions related to City government services in the &quot;Find an Answer&quot; section.
